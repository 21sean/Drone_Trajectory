# Dynamic Drone Pathfinding
# For School Project
Repository of Python modeling and simulation of Dynamic Drone Trajectory data, plotter included.
Dynamic movements includes scenarios which can be modified to see how orientation/velocity effects overall trajectory.


### Prerequisites

Have Python 3.8+ installed, as well as matplotlib and numpy.


## Running the tests

Simple as running Plotter.py pointing to to trajectory.txt


## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
